# WHMCS

WHMCS it self is very well known as The Complete Client Management, Billing & Support Solution. But people also know that WHMCS is very hard to manage the layout, it has it's own WHMCS template but it is very hard to customize, also WHMCS is not built to support SEO so that it is somehow not good enough.

The opposite of WHMCS weakness we have WordPress as well known as a number one opensource support SEO and super easy to customize and create content.

Therefore that the combination of both systems could be amazing right? then we developed Alaska to make it happen.
