# Importing Sample Data

If you\`re using the theme to build a new website which doesn\`t have content yet, I strongly recommend you to use the demo content files. This theme includes xml data files which will allow you to upload the demo content to your website. The content is the same as in the Live Demo Preview.

## Import Layer Slider data

**Step1:** Go to Revolution Slider
