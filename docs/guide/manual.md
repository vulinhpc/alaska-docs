# Manual Installation

**Step 1.** Download ZIP package file from Themeforest and unzip it.

**Step 2.** In unzipped folder you will find a folder named "Alaska Theme" and 2 archives in it: `alaska.zip` file and `alaska-child.zip`. Unzip `alaska.zip` one more time.

**Step 3.** Simply upload the unzipped "alaska" folder to `/wp-content/themes/` folder on your server via FPT. If you want to use the child theme for future theme editing, extract `alaska-child.zip` file and upload `alaska-child` folder to `/wp-content/themes/` folder on your server too.

**Step 4.** Login to your Dashboard, go to Appearance/Themes menu and active Appearance theme.
